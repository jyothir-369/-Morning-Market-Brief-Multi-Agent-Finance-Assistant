AI Tool Usage Log
This document logs the usage of AI tools, specifically Grok 3 by xAI, for generating, structuring, and debugging the code for the Morning Market Brief multi-agent finance assistant. The log includes prompts, code generation steps, and model parameters used during development.
Overview

AI Tool: Grok 3 (xAI)
Purpose: Code generation, debugging, and architectural design for the multi-agent system.
Usage Context: Used to scaffold agent implementations, FastAPI orchestrator, Streamlit app, and test cases. Also used for debugging errors and optimizing modularity.

Code Generation Steps
1. Streamlit App (streamlit_app/app.py)

Prompt: "Generate a Streamlit app that integrates multiple agents for a finance assistant. The app should handle voice and text input for the query 'What's our risk exposure in Asia tech stocks today, and highlight any earnings surprises?' and display/speak the response. Use LangChain for RAG, yfinance for market data, and gTTS for TTS."
Output: Generated the initial app.py with UI components, voice input handling, and agent integration. Modified to include error handling and mock portfolio data.
Parameters: Default Grok 3 settings, text-based output, no DeepSearch or think mode activated.
Iterations: 2 (initial generation, then refined for modularity and error handling).

2. Data Ingestion (data_ingestion/*.py)

Prompt: "Create modular Python scripts for data ingestion: api.py for fetching market data with yfinance, scraper.py for scraping earnings with BeautifulSoup, and document_loader.py for loading documents into LangChain Documents."
Output: Generated api.py, scraper.py, and document_loader.py with error handling and mock data support. Debugged scraper URL handling and document metadata.
Parameters: Default Grok 3 settings, text output.
Iterations: 3 (initial generation, debugged scraper parsing, added mock data for document loader).

3. Agents (agents/*.py)

Prompt: "Generate six agent classes for a finance assistant: APIAgent, ScrapingAgent, RetrieverAgent, AnalysisAgent, LanguageAgent, and VoiceAgent. Each should integrate with data ingestion modules and support FastAPI orchestration."
Output: Generated agent classes with clear interfaces. Debugged LanguageAgent to use distilgpt2 for lightweight LLM processing and VoiceAgent for STT/TTS compatibility.
Parameters: Default Grok 3 settings, text output.
Iterations: 4 (initial generation, debugged FAISS integration, optimized LLM prompt, fixed voice cleanup).

4. Orchestrator (orchestrator/*.py)

Prompt: "Create a FastAPI orchestrator with main.py and router.py to coordinate agents for a finance assistant. Include an endpoint to process queries and return text/audio responses."
Output: Generated main.py for FastAPI setup and router.py for orchestration logic. Debugged endpoint error handling and agent sequencing.
Parameters: Default Grok 3 settings, text output.
Iterations: 2 (initial generation, refined for fallback logic).

5. Tests (tests/*.py)

Prompt: "Write unit tests for agents (test_agents.py) and end-to-end pipeline tests (test_pipeline.py) using pytest. Mock external dependencies like yfinance and requests."
Output: Generated test files with mocks for external APIs and agent interactions. Debugged test coverage for pipeline orchestration.
Parameters: Default Grok 3 settings, text output.
Iterations: 2 (initial generation, added edge case tests).

Model Parameters

Model: Grok 3
Mode: Standard mode (no DeepSearch or think mode used due to API-based development).
Temperature: 0.7 for code generation to balance creativity and precision.
Max Tokens: 2048 for detailed code and documentation outputs.
Prompt Style: Structured prompts with clear requirements (e.g., "generate modular Python code", "include error handling").

Debugging and Optimization

Issue: Scraper in scraper.py failed on dynamic news pages.
Prompt: "Debug BeautifulSoup parsing for Yahoo Finance news and suggest a simpler scraping approach."
Fix: Adjusted regex for headline matching and added mock data fallback.


Issue: LanguageAgent response length was too verbose.
Prompt: "Optimize LangChain prompt template to generate concise narrative responses."
Fix: Modified prompt template to enforce brevity.


Issue: VoiceAgent audio cleanup failed on Windows.
Prompt: "Fix file cleanup in VoiceAgent for cross-platform compatibility."
Fix: Added try-except block for file deletion.



Notes

All code was reviewed and manually adjusted for modularity and readability.
AI tool usage was critical for rapid prototyping and debugging, reducing development time by ~50%.
Logs are based on interactions on May 28, 2025, via Grok 3's text interface.
